# Codebar Workshop 24th June 2024

## Goals
- Set up a Web Socket server
- Configure a Web Socket client
- Add frontend requirements
- **Extra challenge: add a frontend feature**

## Prerequisites
You will need Node.js v18 or greater installed. You can find out if you have Node.js by opening up a terminal and typing in
```
node --version
```
If you don't have it installed, or you have a version lower than 18, you can download Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en).

## Getting started
To get this project up and running, you'll need to install the dependancies
```
npm install
```

Once you've installed the dependancies, you can run the web app using the following command:
```
npm run start
```

You may be asked to install nodemon, by typing `y`, after which the server will start up. You can then navigate to `localhost:3000` to access the chat app.
